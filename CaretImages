#### MAKE PUBLICATION QUALITY IMAGES IN CARET ####
##################################################

#NOTE: These instructions were written for NMF files, so might differ for your files.

1. Download caret

http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:Download

2. Download the templates Ted likes to use (see my email). Put them here:

/Applications/caret/data_files/standard_mesh_atlases/

in a new folder called "standard_mesh_atlases_TED" so you don't overwrite the default templates.

3. Warp your InputFile.nii.gz file (the file with your clusters) into MNI space for caret:

antsApplyTransforms -e 3 -d 3 -r /share/apps/fsl/5.0.8/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain.nii.gz -o OutputFile.nii.gz -i InputFile.nii.gz -t /data/joy/BBL/studies/pnc/template/pnc2mni0Warp.nii.gz -t /data/joy/BBL/studies/pnc/template/pnc2mni1GenericAffine.mat

4. Use sftp to download the MNI file to the local computer (the files will be in Machintosh HD/Users/username or look for them in "All My Files").
    get filepath/filename.nii.gz
